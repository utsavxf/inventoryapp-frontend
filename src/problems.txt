QUESTIONS:
->TO HOLD REFERENCE OF THE WHOLE OBJECT OR KEEP JUST ID AND THEN RETRIEVE IT FROM BEHAVIOUR SUBJECT
->LABEL CHECK IN NEO4j, employee-department(engineering) example
->HOW DOES SIGNALS IMPROVE REACTIVITY SPECIALLY FOR local Properties
->label check or no label check?
->idea of exposing 1 signal as read only is being defeated since we are accessing the main signal out of their own service -> make functions inside their own respective services
->to avoid infinite recursion is JsonIdentityInfo a good way

FIRST HOW TO AVOID MULTIPLE HTTP REQUEST AND DO STATE MANAGEMENT
->Rxjs Library,observables,behaviour subjects,signals

CIRCULAR LOOP IN JSON (DEVICE AND SHELF POSITIONS)
->used the annotation JsonIdentityInfo

IN HOME PAGE REQUESTS BEING MADE AGAIN AND AGAIN WHEN WE NAVIGATE BACK TO IT AND WHEN WE GO FROM HOME TO DEVICE THE FETCH ALL DEVICES SHOULD NOT BE CALLED AGAIN,BUT WHEN WE ARE ON DEVICE PAGE AND WE REFRESHES IT SHOULD BE CALLED
->why does it happens: When you navigate away from a component and then back to it, Angular destroys the previous instance of the component and creates a new one, which leads to ngOnInit being called again.

->in the service we can use an additional variable to see if all device/shelves/shelfPositions are fetched or not and use basic if-else logic

WHY NEO4J ONLY SHOWS NAME AND TYPE PROPERTIES AND NOT OTHERS
->because those are not stored as property ,those are stored as relationships

CIRCULAR DEPEDENCY ERROR AS DEVICE SERVICE IN SHELF POSITION SERVICE AND VICE AND VERSA
->used Injectors to lazily fetch the services
